    %p Marcin discovered Ruby in 2007 and instantly fell in love amused by it's elegant beauty. At the beginning of 2008 he joined Ragnarson in their mission of creating kick-ass rails apps. Always tries to keep things as simple as possible and to end each day with new knowledge.  Marcin is a big fan of applied art, Gordon Ramsay's shows, American muscle-cars designed before 80's and thrash metal music.
