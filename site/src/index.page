            <p>
              Ragnarson gives us well-integrated, tested code that drops
              right into our own Ruby on Rails projects, and the turnaround
              times are great. This flexibility and speed lets us improve our
              software exactly when and how we need to.

            <p>
              We are working with Ragnarson for over 5 years now. With
              the help of their developers we built up two extensive sites.
              The work with Ragnarson developers is very pleasant, as they
              deliver on time, put a lot of thought into the code and the
              sites itself and are able to handle problems within minutes
              of notice.
