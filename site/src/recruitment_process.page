### The Test

Even if you get that far know, that we only accept proven developers. CV is nothing compared to a nice, clean commit on GitHub.

To be considered worthy show us your code!

If you haven't taken part in any OSS project yet, now is your chance:

- Find a RSpec based Ruby project.
- Within that project find a ticket (feature, bug) that matches will show your abilities well.
- Get in touch with maintainer and accept that ticket.
- Fix it, making sure your specs are throughout.
- Push your commits and send us link to them.

If your commit(s) will pass our internal inspection we will be glad to talk about cooperation details.
